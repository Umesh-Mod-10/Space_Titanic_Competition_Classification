## Space Titanic Spaceship Survival:

In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic, a grand interstellar passenger liner, embarked on its maiden voyage to transport emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets. However, disaster struck when the ship collided with a hidden spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri. Almost half of the passengers vanished into an alternate dimension, leaving behind a perplexing puzzle for us to solve. Our mission is clear: predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly. By analyzing recovered records from the spaceship’s damaged computer system, we can uncover clues and rescue the lost souls.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about the passengers, their characteristics, and their fate. Each record provides details such as passenger ID, age, occupation, and personal history. Our task is to identify patterns and anomalies that can guide us in predicting who was affected by the spacetime rift.

# Techniques Used
Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset to understand its structure and uncover hidden insights.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that capture relevant information about the passengers.
Machine Learning Models: Utilize advanced techniques to predict the fate of each passenger.
Your Role
As a data scientist, your skills are crucial in deciphering the cosmic mystery. Let’s analyze the data, build models, and bring the lost passengers back home!
